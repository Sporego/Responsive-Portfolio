                    Hello, I'm Filbert.
                    <br>
                    I'm 21 years old.
                    <br>
                    Former Counter-Strike Pro. (12th in Mountain Few League) (1st @ Waypoint by ESL ONE NY) (4-8th GexCon 2017) (3-4tbr h GexCon 2018) (4th NSG Showcase 2018)
                    <br>
                    Over the last three years, I've been taking better care of my health. Since then, I've been running at least 4 times a week for 1-2 hours; getting into yoga during the colder months; additionally, I've been trying to get into the habit of meditating.
                    <br>
                    Life has been a very intresting experiance, sometimes I can't believe the life I chose to live. I've quit school and ended up playing professional counter-strike for 2.5 years. Now I'm learning full stack programming @ Columbia University in the City of New York.
                    <br>
                    I'm a believer in following your heart. Deciding to commit my life to a video game wasn't easy. There has been so many times in the beginning where people would come up to me and tell me, "you aren't good enough." Convince me in different ways to give up and tread the road most take. In those days there would be times where I would ask myself if "I was wasting my time." Eventually, I ended up getting sponsored and competeing and even winning one tournament. 
                    <br>
                    I realized from my proffesional experiance that our achievements don't define our self-worth. In the end, even if you are famous for something; most of the appreciated and acceptance of your success comes from yourself. Other people might congradulate you, but most will easily forget. All it takes is for some time to scroll by and BAM, the knowledge of your past is lost.
                    <br>
                    I was born in NYC and raised in Queens. I went to P.S. 162 from kindergarden to 5th grade. Then I attended M.S. 216 from grades 6-8th. I was lucky enough to have the oppertunity to go to "The Bronx Highschool of Science" from grades 9-12th. I attended SUNY Buffalo for 2 semesters, before I quit school to go full-time in counter-strike. I'm young so that is the story so far...
                    <br>
                    As a 21 year old, I notice that generally I have more charisma and courage then my peers. I'm not perfect, I believe I have a tendancy to over-extend myself and from that under achieve my personal goals.
